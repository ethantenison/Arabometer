# Sentiment Analysis of Trump & Biden's Tweets 

<br />

Using data from Kaggle and the Trump Twitter Archive, I aim to run a sentiment analyis comparison of Trump and Biden's tweets from Janurary 1, 2020 to August 15, 2020. This period covers one of the most tumulutous times in modern American history when the COVID-19 pandemic began and massive protests erupted accross the United States as a result of the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
